  Brownie points time!

  Some of this code is good, I think.
  Some of it is really bad... :()
  That's okay though because the bad code isn't unfixable!

  If I was looking at this for the first time, my biggest gripe would
  be that there is a lot going on in this ns.

  I think my first step would be to a file structure like,
  src/my_exercise/home.clj
  src/my_exercise/home/view.clj
  src/my_exercise/search.clj
  src/my_exercise/search/view.clj

  My second biggest gripe is the lack of specs.
  I really enjoy the flexibility of multimethods and leveraging spec
  for things like the `ocd-id` multimethod.
  Given the flexible nature of the data coming back from Turbovote,
  I think the views would appreciate some multimethods like I described
  above the `voting-methods` function.

  My third move would be to get organized with the building of the
  Turbovote URL. Right now it's pretty choppy which I'm not big on.
  A little TLC and some smarter threading macro action and you've got
  a very nice little data pipeline for easier testing and simpler code.

  My last and final move would be toward serious validation/execution scheme
  for the code a la http://cjohansen.no/referentially-transparent-crud/

  At the end of the day it looks like exactly what it is, I think, which is
  nervous code written under a time crunch. Which is cool, because I think
  my best projects have all started there at some point trying to get a
  quick and dirty POC done to impress some peeps! Just as long as those bad
  practices are cleaned up in small bits, you'll wind up in a good spot.)
